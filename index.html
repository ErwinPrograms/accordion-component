                            Our long-term plan is to make roadmap.sh a go-to
                            place for developers whenever they plan on learning
                            something new. We started with roadmaps, guides,
                            videos and other visual content but we plan on
                            introducing best practices, best-practices for
                            certain tasks, quizzes to test your knowledge and
                            prepare yourself for the interviews, project ideas
                            to work on while following the roadmaps, public
                            profiles to share your progress and interact with
                            the other learners and so on.
